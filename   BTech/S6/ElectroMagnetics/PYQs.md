2. A point charge of $6 nC$ is located at origin in free space. Find the potential difference between the points $P1 (0.2,-0.4, 0.4)$ and $P2 (1, 0, 0)$. [^2]
3. Calculate the capacitance of $1 km$ length of an air-filled co-axial cable with inner diameter $6 mm$ and outer diameter $14 mm$.

[^1]:
    $\overrightarrow A \cdot \overrightarrow B = \left( 2 \overrightarrow a_{x}+ \overrightarrow a_{y} - 2 \overrightarrow a_z \right) \cdot \left( 5 \overrightarrow a_x - 10 \overrightarrow a_y + 3 \overrightarrow a_z \right) = - 6 \times \frac{\overrightarrow B}{|B|^2} = -6 \times \frac{\overrightarrow B}{134}$
    e

[^2]: $\frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\left({1 \over r_{1}} - {1 \over r_{2}} \right) = 25-9 = 16 \ Volts$
