##### Op-amp Oscillators and Multivibrators:
- [x] Phase Shift and âœ… 2024-06-20
- Wien-bridge Oscillators,
- Triangular and Sawtooth waveform generators,
- Astable and monostable multivibrators.
##### Active filters:
- Comparison with passive filters,
- First and second order low pass,
- High pass,
- Band pass and
- band reject active filters,
- state variable filters.


#### RC Phase Shift Osfc = {vocillator
$$
fc = {1 \over 2\pi R C \sqrt{6}}
$$
fc -> Frequency of oscillation

#### Wein Bridge Oscillator

$$
f_o = {1 \over 2 \pi RC} = {0.159 \over RC}
$$

##### Gain 

$$
Av = {1 \over \beta} = 3 
$$
