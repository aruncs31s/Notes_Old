### Production 
It is the transformation of inputs into output.
##### Production function 
It is defined as the relationship which shows maximum level of output producible from given inputs 

$$
Q = f(L_a,L,K,O)
$$
 K -> Capital
 L -> Labour
 O -> Organization
 La -> Land
Q -> Quantity

2 types of production function 
1. The law of Variable Proportion(Short Run)
2. The law of Fixed Proportion (Long Run)

##### Variable Proportion
Only one variable getting changed while keeping other variable in the production function constant.
- Labour is the easily adjustable factor
- It happens in ==short run== due to unavailability of all inputs 

##### Fixed Proportion 

#### Basic Production Concepts 
##### Total Product(TP)/ Total Physical Product(TPP)
It refers to the total amount of commodity produced during given prtiod of time with each set of inputs. It is also  know as Total Returns.

##### Average Product(AP)
It is the output produced ==using per unit of the variable factor== inputs 
$$
AP =\frac{TP}{L} or \frac{Q}{L}
$$

##### Marginal Product
It is the addition to total product form the use of an additional unit of variable factor input.
$$
MP = TP n - TP n-1 
$$

$$
MP =\frac{d(TP)}{d(L)} or  \frac{\Delta TP}{\Delta L }
$$


#### Law of Variable Proportion 
It states that as more and more units of a variable factor are applied to a given quantity to a fixed factor, the total product increase at an ==increasing rate initially, but eventually it will increase at a diminishing rate==.
