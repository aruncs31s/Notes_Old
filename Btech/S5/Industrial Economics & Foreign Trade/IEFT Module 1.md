### Scarcity and Choice

#### Scarcity

This refers to the state of being ==short in supply because of limitless wants==. Notably, it is one of the major macroeconomic concerns affecting the allocation of resources in the economy.Scarcity is why economics exist: we wouldn't have to worry about how scarce resources are allocated if those resources were unlimited. It should be emphasized that economics is primarily concerned with the scarcity ofÂ **resources**.

- Since we face Scarcity, people have to make choice between goods and services.

### Basic or Central Economic Problems

- What goods and services shall be produced and in what quantities?
- How shall goods and services be produced?
  - If goods are produced by employing more labor and less capital then it's known as labor intensive method of production.
  - And if goods are produced by employing more capital(machinery etc.) then it is known as capital intensive method of production
- For whom goods and services are to be produced?

### PPC

Product possiblility curve/Frontier shows the various combinations of two comodities that can be produced with latest technology available and with given resources utilized fully and efficiently.
###### Assumptions
- Only 2 comodities 
- Latest technology 
- Resource is fully utilized

#features
- Downward slope : Production of one good can be increased only after sacrificing production of some quality of the other good. the few units we sacrifice for the others, as there exists an inverse relationship between the change in quantity of one commodity and the change in quantity of the other commodities.
- PPC isÂ _concave-shaped_Â because more and more units of one commodity are sacrificed to gain an additional unit of another commodity.
- However,Â if there is unemployment or inefficiency in resource utilisation, then we can produce at any point inside the PPC.

Economic actors receive less and less satisfaction from consuming incremental amounts of a good , ie, ==**Adding an additional factor of production results in smaller increases in output**==
