# Gauss's Law

> [!NOTE] Statement
> Gauss's Law for Electric field states that the *total flux through any surface is the charge enclosed by the surface divided by $\epsilon_0$*
$$
\psi = \oint E \cdot dS = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 }  
$$

> [!Note] Statement 2  From Edminister
> Gauss's Law states that the *total flux out of a closed surface is equal to the net charge within the surface*
> Mathematicaly
>$$
\oint D \cdot dS = Q_{enc}
