# Volume Integral

There are 2 types

1.  $$
    Q = \int_{v}\large \rho_{v} dV
    $$

> Where scalar $\large \rho_v$ is the _Volume Density Function_ such as charge density and in that case $Q$ will represent the total charge contained in the volume

2.  $$
    {\large \bar{P}} = \int_V PdV \tag{2}
    $$

> This is the Volume Integral of a vector. In cartesian coordinates,and equation $(1)$ can be written as

$$
\large \bar P = a_x \int_V P_x dV + a_y \int_V P_y dV + a_z \int_V P_z dV
$$
