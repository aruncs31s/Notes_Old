### Differential Volume , Surface, and Line Elements

When the co-ordinates of point P are expanded to $(x + dx,y+dy+z+dz)$ or $(r + dr,\phi + d\phi , z+ dz)$ or $(r+dr , \theta + d\theta , \phi + d\phi)$ a **differential volume** $dv$ is formed

## Part 2

### Contents

1. Electric field and magnetic field
2. Review of Coulombâ€™s law
3. Gauss law and Amperes current law
4. [[coulomb's law]]
5. 

### Fields

**Field is a function that specifies a particular quantity everywhere in a region**

There are 2 types of fields

1. Scalar Fields : If the quantity is scalar eg : sound intensity in a theater
2. Vector Fields : If the quantity is vector eg: Velocity of raindrops in the atmosphere


#### Electric Field Due to a Point charge

![[2 charges sep by r drawing]]
Consider two charges $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ separated by a distance $R$

- If $Q_{1} \times Q_{2} > 0$ similar charges
- If $Q_{1} \times Q_{2} < 0$ opposite charges

Where Magnitude of force

$$
F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{R^{2}}\tag{Opposite charges}
$$

$$
F = -\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{Q_{1} Q_{2}}{R^{2}}\tag{Similar charges}
$$

The electric field by a point charge $Q$ is the amount of force on $IC$ charge

$$
\begin{align*}

E &= {F \over Q} = F \tag{Q = 1C}
\end{align*}
$$

$\therefore$ Electric field due to a point charge is

$$
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{Q} {R^{2}}
$$

![[Electric field direction.excalidraw]]

- If we have ==positive charge== then the electric field will happening in ==outward direction==.
- If we have ==negative charge== then the electric field will happening in ==inward direction==.


#### Electric Field Intensity 
It is defined as the ==Force per unit charge on Q== ,the unit is $N/C$ or $V/m$  
$$
E = \frac{F_t}{Q_{r}} 
$$
$$
E = \frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}r^{2}} \overrightarrow a_{r}\tag{Spherical}
$$
$$
E = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0 R^{2}}} \overrightarrow a_R\tag{Cartesian}
$$

#### Electric Flux Density 
The flux 

#### Charge Distributions
- [[#Line charge]]
- [[#Sheet Charge]]
- [[#Volume Charge]]
##### Line Charge Distribution
It describes a charge distribution in which the ==charge is distributed over a curved line== ,and each differential charge $dQ$ along the line produces electric field It is the total charge by the length of the line , it's denoted by $\rho_l$ and unit is $(C/m)$ 
> Differential electric field $dE$
>$$
 dE = \frac{qQ}{4\pi \epsilon_{0 }R^{2}}\overrightarrow a_R 
>$$
>Total electric field at P is given no other charges present in that region 
>$$
E = \int_{L} \frac{\rho_l \overrightarrow a_{R} }{4\pi \epsilon_{0 R^{2}}} dl
>$$
>
>

##### Sheet Charge Distribution
Where the charge is distributed along a surface or sheet , so also called surface charge distribution , Denoted by $\rho_S$ unit is $(C/m^2)$ 

> Here the differential charge $qQ$ on the surface/sheet results in an electric field 
>$$
dE = \frac{dQ}{4\pi \epsilon_{0 R^{2}}}\overrightarrow a_R
>$$
>$$
E = \int_{S} \frac{\rho_{S}\overrightarrow a_{R}}{4\pi \epsilon_{0 R^2}}dS
>$$
>

##### Volume Charge Distribution
Distribution of charge within a volume of space , Denoted by $\rho_V$

 
$$
\rho = \frac{dQ}{dv} \tag{C/m3}
$$
>The differential charges $dQ$ produces a differential electric field
>$$
dE = \frac{dQ}{4\pi \epsilon_{0 R^{2}}}dv
>$$
> And the total electric field is 
>$$
E = \int_{L} \frac{\rho_{v} \overrightarrow a_{R}}{4\pi \epsilon_{0 R^2}}dv
>$$

- [[#Point Charge]]
- [[#Infinite Line Charge]]


> [!NOTE] NOTE 
> 
> Charges are not on a **conductor** it is suspended in space,fixed in the specified configuration
#### Point Charge 
- Electric Field of a point charge is
$$
E = \frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_{0 r^{2}}} \overrightarrow a_{r}\tag{spherical }
$$
#### Infinite Line Charge 
If charge is distributed with uniform density $\rho_{l} (C/m)$ along an infinite, straight line (z axis) , then the field is given by 
$$
E = \frac{\rho_{l}}{2\pi \epsilon_{0 r}}\overrightarrow a_r\tag{Cylindrical}
$$

$$
dQ = \rho \cdot dv \tag{C}
$$
By integrating the above equation 
$$
Q = \int_{v} \rho \cdot dv\tag{C} 
$$
> This equation can be used to find the net charge present in a specified volume

#exampleProblem 
> [!Problem] Example 3.1 
> Find the charge in the volume defined by $1 \le r \le 2 \ m$ by integration, in spherical coordinates, if 
>$$
\rho = \frac{5 \cos^{2}\phi}{r^{4}}

>[!Success] Answer
> We know [[#Net charge in a region]] so by integrating the above equation 
$$
\begin{align*}
