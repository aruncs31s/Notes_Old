# Ampere's Law
*The ==line integral== of the tangential component of the magnetic field around a closed path is equal to the current enclosed by the path*
$$
\oint H \cdot dI = I_{enc}
$$
> This law provides a way of finding $H$ using $I_{enc}$ 


### Conditions to be true
1. At each poin of the closed path $H$ is either tangential or normal to the path
2. $H$ has the same value at all points of the path where $H$ is tangential
