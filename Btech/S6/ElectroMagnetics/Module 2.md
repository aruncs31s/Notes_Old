### Maxwell's Equations 
*Maxwell equations are based on 3 fundamental laws*
1. [[Ampere's Law]] 
2. [[Faraday's Law of induction]] 
3. [[Gauss's Law]] 

#### From Ampere's Circuit Law
$$
\nabla  \overrightarrow H = \overrightarrow J
$$

> 

#### Maxwell's 1st Equation with Integral Form And Differential Form 
##### Prerequisites
1. [[Gauss's Law]] 

> From [[Gauss's Law]]  
>$$
\oint D \cdot dS = Q_{enc}\tag{1}
>$$
> For volume charge
>$$
\int_v \rho_{v}dv = Q_{enc}\tag{2}
>$$
>Where $\rho_v$ is volume charge density 
>by comparing equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ 
$$
\oint \overrightarrow D \cdot dS = \int_{v}\rho_{v}dv \tag{A}
>$$
>The above equation is known as *Integral form of [[Maxwell|Maxwell's]] First Equation*

> As per [[Gauss Divergence Theorem]] 
$$
\overrightarrow A \cdot dS = \int \overrightarrow \nabla \cdot \overrightarrow A \ dv \tag{3}
>$$
>By comparing eqn $(A)$ with $(3)$
$$
\oint \overrightarrow \nabla \cdot \overrightarrow D \ dv = 
$$
