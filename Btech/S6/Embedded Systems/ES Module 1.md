#### Embedded System
*It an Electro-mechanical which is a ==combination of software and hardware design(working together) to do a specific task==*
*It is any device that includes a programmable computer but is not itself intended to be a general-purpose computer. Thus, a PC is not itself an embedded computing system, although PCs are often used to build embedded computing systems. But a fax machine or a clock built from a microprocessor is an embedded computing system.*

#characteristics
Embedded System that execute limited number of fixed tasks, because the tasks do not change during the life span of an embedded system , it is not general programmable in the way that personal computer is.
