# Word Line 
 The Word Line is another signal line in [SRAM](Ram.md#SRAM) that is ==used to select a specific row of memory cells==.
	- ==When a word line is activated (brought to a high voltage),== it enables access to the memory cells in the corresponding row.
	- During a read operation, activating the word line allows the data stored in the selected row to be accessed via the bit lines.
	- During a write operation, activating the word line enables the selected memory cells to be written to or modified based on the data present on the bit lines.
- Word Lines are used to select one particular row(or word) in memory
