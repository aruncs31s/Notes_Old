# Ram

- There are two types of RAM
  1.  SRAM[^1]
  2.  DRAM[^2]

[^1]: **SRAM** Static Random-Access Memory is a type of **volatile memory** used in computers and SRAM uses **latching circuitry** (specifically flip-flops) to store each bit of data. Unlike **dynamic random-access memory (DRAM)**, which requires periodic refreshing, ==SRAM retains its data as long as it has power==
[^2]:

> [!NOTE] SRAM
>  **SRAM** exhibits **data remanence**, which means ==it retains data even after power is turned off==. Unlike dynamic RAM (DRAM), which requires periodic refreshing to maintain data integrity, SRAM uses latching circuitry (specifically flip-flops) to store each bit of data. As long as SRAM has power, it retains its stored information. However, ==once power is removed, the data is lost==. This property makes SRAM suitable for use in CPU caches and internal registers, where speed and reliability are essential

### SRAM

It is a type of Random Access Memory(RAM) that uses latching circuit[^3](flip flops) to store each bit. SRAM is volatile memory ==data is lost when power is removed==.

- Requires 6 transistors

*WL* -> WordLine
*BL* -> WordLine


> [!important]  Word Line
> The Word Line is another signal line in [SRAM](Ram.md#SRAM) that is ==used to select a specific row of memory cells==.
>  - ==When a word line is activated (brought to a high voltage),== it enables access to the memory cells in the corresponding row.
>  - During a read operation, activating the word line allows the data stored in the selected row to be accessed via the bit lines.
>  - During a write operation, activating the word line enables the selected memory cells to be written to or modified based on the data present on the bit lines.
>  - Word Lines are used to select one particular row(or word) in memory
 

 
> [!NOTE] Bit Line
> Bit Line is a signal line in [SRAM](Ram.md#SRAM) that connects to the storage nodes of memory cells within a specific row ,
> - During a read operation, the stored data is accessed by activating the appropriate word line and ==sensing the voltage level on the bit line to determine whether it represents a logic high or low==.
> - During a write operation, the ==bit line is used to write data into the memory cells==. The desired data is placed on the bit line, and the appropriate word line is activated to store the data in the selected memory cell 
> *While Reading*
>While read operation, the contents of selected word will be available on bit lines.

#working

- If a 1 is created in one side, then automatically , a 0 is generated at other side due to inverters.
- If access transistors are off, then the cell holds the value



#### SRAM Read Write Operation

![|400x300](<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/SRAM_Cell_(6_Transistors).svg/800px-SRAM_Cell_(6_Transistors).svg.png>)

Here

- **M1** and **M2** -> Inverter 1
- **M3** and **M4** -> Inverter 2
- **M5** and **M6** -> Access Transistors

- During Read/Write operation, access transistors(**M5** and **M6** ) will be enabled and output/input will be available in bit line.

##### Read Operation

- First Assume that $Q = 1 \ and \  \overline Q = 0$
- Before starting read operation, $BL \ and \  \overline {BL}$ are **precharged[^4] to VDD**
- As per $Q\ \& \ \overline  Q$

| M1  | ON  | Inverter 1 |
| --- | --- | ---------- |
| M2  | OFF | Inverter 1 |
| M3  | OFF | Inverter 2 |
| M4  | ON  | Inverter 2 |

- To initiate read operation, ==**WL** is made high(1)== thus turning on $M5 \  \& \ M6$
  ![](Pasted%20image%2020240418071342.png)
- Since $M5$ and $M1$ are on, $\overline {BL}$ will discharge through them. So Voltage at $\overline {BL}$ reduces
- Since $Q=1 \ \& \ BL=1$ , there is no current flow through $M6$ . So $BL$ voltage remains same

- $BL \ \& \ \overline {BL}$ are given to comparator.
  - _Here $\ \ BL > \ \ \overline {BL}$ , So comparator ==gives output as 1== , and which is the value read from memory cell_
  - Insted, if the contents of cell was diffrent, ie $Q=0 \ \& \overline Q =1$ then upon initiating read operation, BL will discharge & $\overline {BL}$ remains the same.
    - So $\overline BL \gt BL$ & ==output of comparator will be 0==

[^4]: Precharging in CMOS refers to a technique used in digital circuits to manage the charging and discharging of certain nodes or components.
[^3]: **flipflops** and **latches** are circuits that have ==two stable states that can store state information==
