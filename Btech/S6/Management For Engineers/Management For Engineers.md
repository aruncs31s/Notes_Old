## Module 3 Productivity and Decision Making

### Syllabus

- Concept of productivity[^1] and its measurement
- Competitiveness
- Decision Making Process
- Decision making under certainty,risk and uncertainty 
- Decision trees 
- Models of decision making
### Productivity 
Productivity generally refers to the ==efficiency with which someone or something produces goods, services, or results==. It's often ==measured by the ratio of output to input==.
- productivity can refer to ==how effectively someone manages their time, resources, and energy to achieve their goals or complete tasks==
- It often involves ==maximizing the output of goods or services while minimizing input==, such as time, labor, or costs. Productivity can be influenced by various factors including technology, organization, motivation, and skill level.
- It is a measure of how well resources are used
- It measures the ==efficiency of the production system==
#### Productivity Measures
- It is called a ==relative measure== because, to be meaningful,it needs to be compared with something else.
- It may be expressed as partial measures , multi-factor measures , or total measures .

$$
Productivity = \frac{Output}{Input}
$$
-  *Output* : Implies production(Quantity of goods and service Produced)
- *Inputs* : It may be land , labor capital,management etc.
- 
![System concept of Productivity](System%20concept%20of%20Productivity.canvas)

Higher level of productivity is maintained to keep the long term growth of the firm and economy as a whole.A high productivity means that the resources are utilized to the optimum, while minimizing the wastage, this leads to reduction in cost of production , subsequentl availability of Quantity products to customers at lower price. Profitability of the firm is also related to its productivity

##### Main types of Productivity measures 
- *Single factor* : Measure of input to a single measure of Output
- *Multi factor* : Measure of output to a bundle of Inputs
- *Total factor* : Measures of total input to total outputs

##### Calculation of Value added Productivity (At firm level)
$$
VA \ per \ employee = \frac{Firm's \ Value  \ Added($)}{Total\ No.\ of \ employees \ on \ firm's \ payroll}
$$

```

### Syllabus

- Project Management , Network construction, Arrow Diagram, Redundancy.
- CPM and PERT Networks, Scheduling ,computations, PERT time estimates,Probability of completion of Project 
- Introduction to crashing

### Project 
- A series of related jobs usually directed toward some major output and requiring a significant period of time to perform

> [!NOTE] ANSI definition
> Project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service or result 

- Projects differ in `composition`, `type` ,`scope`, `size` and `time`

#### Project Performance Dimensions
- 3 major dimensions that define the project perfomance
  1. Scope 
  2. Time
  3. Resources
- The relationship is generally represented as an quilateral triangle(Qualit Triangle)


![](Pasted%20image%2020240417010147.png)

- The ==Performance of a project== is measured by the degree to which these three parameters (scope,time,and cost) are achieved
$$
Performance = f(Scope,Cost,Time)
$$

#### Project Management
*Project Management is a unique discipline that involves planning, organizing, and executing projects. It focuses on achieving specific goals within defined constraints such as time, cost, and scope.*

- It consists of 
  1. **Project Manager**
  3. **Project Team**
  3. **Project Management System**

- Key Features of Project Management:
 1. **Planning**: Defining project objectives, scope, and deliverables.
 2. **Organizing**: Allocating resources, creating schedules, and forming teams
 3. **Executing**: Carrying out project tasks, monitoring progress, and managing risks.
 4. **Controlling**: Tracking performance, adjusting plans, and ensuring quality.
 5. **Closing**: Finalizing project activities, evaluating outcomes, and documenting lessons learned.
- Elements of Effective Project Management:
	1. Scope: Clearly define project boundaries and objectives.
	2. Time: Develop realistic schedules and milestones.
	3. Cost: Manage budget and expenses.
	4. Quality: Ensure deliverables meet standards.
	5. Risk: Identify and mitigate potential risks.
	6. Communication: Maintain effective communication among stakeholders.
	7. 
#### CPM and PERT

##### CPM (Critical Path Method)
CPM is a technique which is used for the projects where the ==time needed for completion of project is already known==. CPM determines the ==earliest possible starting time for each task in the project==. It also identifies critical tasks that directly impact the projectâ€™s duration. 
- It calculates the **critical path**, which is the longest sequence of tasks or the shortest duration for project completion
#### **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**
Used for ==managing projects with uncertain activity durations and probabilistic estimates==. Incorporates three time estimates (**optimistic**, **most likely**, and **pessimistic**) for each activity to calculate expected project duration. Useful for projects where activity durations are uncertain or influenced by external factors.
