##### Groups

A set _G_ on which binary operation $*$ is defined is called **Group** , and it should satisfy the following conditions

1. The binary operation $*$ is associative
2. $G$ contains an element $\large e$ such that , for any $\large a$ in $G$
   $$
   \large a \ * \ e = e \ * \ a = a
   $$

- e -> identity element of $G$
1. For any element $a$ in $G$, there exists another element $a\prime$ in $G$ such that 
$$
a \times a\prime = a\prime \times a = e
$$
- *Where $a\prime$ is called an inverse of a *

4. A group `G` is said to be commutative if its binary operation , also satisfies the following . For any `a` and `b` `G`
$$
a \times b = b \times a
$$

#example

$$
G = \{0,1\}
$$

##### Block Codes

A block code consists of a set of fixed length **codewords**. ==The fixed length of these codewords is called the Block Length==. And is Typically denoted by $n$ . Thus a code of blocklength $n$ consists of a set of codewords having n componets

> A block code of size M is defined over an alphabet with $q$ symbols is a set of M q-ary sequence , each of length $n$ . In the special case that $q$=2 , the symbol are called bits and the code is said to be binary code .Usually , $M=q^k$ for some integer $k$ , and we call such code as an $(n,k)$ code
