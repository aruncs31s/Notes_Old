## Introduction

### Fourier Series

The Fourier series is a mathematical tool used to ==represent a periodic function as the sum of simple sine and cosine functions==. It is named after Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, who introduced the concept in the early 19th century. The Fourier series is particularly useful for ==analyzing signals that are periodic in nature==.

### Fourier Transform

The Fourier Transform is a mathematical technique used in signal processing and image analysis, among other fields, ==to transform a function of time (a signl) into a function of frequency==

#### Inverse Fourier Transform

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{j\omega t} d
\omega\
$$

### Discrete-Time Fourier Series

$$
x[n] = \sum_{K=0}^{N} X[k]e^{j\Omega_0 n}
$$

$$
X = {1 \over N} \sum_{n=0}^{N} x[n]e^{-jk\Omega_0n}
$$

_$x[n]$ and $X[k]$ have period $N$_

$$
\Omega_0 = {2 \pi \over N}
$$

### Discrete-Time Fourier Transform

- For discrete time non-periodic signals
- Continuous and periodic with a period of 2
- $$
  x[n] = {1 \over 2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} X\left(e^{j\Omega}\right) e^{j\Omega n} d\Omega\tag{Synthesis Equation}
  $$

$$
X(e^{j\Omega}) \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} x[n]e^{-j\Omega n}\tag{Analysis Equation}
$$

_where $X(e^{j\Omega})$ has period $2\pi$_

#### Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT)

- **DFT** of a finite duration sequence $x[n]$ is obtained by sampling **[[#Discrete-Time Fourier Transform|DTFT]]** at **N** equally spaced points over the interval $0\le \omega \le 2\pi$ with spacing $2\pi \over N$

> [!NOTE] Spacing
> The Spacing in the [[#Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT)|DFT]] increases with decrease in the no of sampling points taken , if the N = 4 , The points will be $\large0,{\pi\over 2},\pi,{3 \pi \over 2}$
>
> - The N points should be located at $$\omega_k = {2\pi \over N} k$$ ,where $k = 1,2,3,.....,N-1$

- [ ] Complete this above statement

#equation

$$
X(k) = X(e^{jw}) \ , \omega = {2\pi \over N} k
$$

##### N Point DFT

- **N point DFT** of a finite duration sequence x[n] of length L($L\le N$) can be calculated as
  $$
  X(k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{\large -j2\pi \over N} kn
  $$
  _where $k=0,1,2,....N-1$_

### Filtering out long data sequences

#### Overlap - save method

Let's consider an input sequence $x(n)$ of length $L$, and response $h(n)$ of length $M$, the steps to follow overlap - save method is

1. : Input $x(n)$ is ==divided into length== $L (L>M)$
2. : ==Calculate the length== $N=L+M-1$
3. : ==Add $M-1$ zeros to the start of first segment==, each segment (length = L) has its ==first $M-1$ points coming from previous segment==, making each of length $N$
4. : Make ==impulse response to length N by adding zeros==
5. : ==Find== the ==circular convolution== of each new segments with new $h(n)$
6. : Linearly combine each results and take sequence of length L+M-1 from that by discarding/removing first $M-1$ points



#### Overlap - add method

Filtering of long duration sequences  
Let's consider an input sequence x(n) of length L, and response h(n) of length M, the steps to follow overlap - save method is

1. : Input $x(n)$ is divided into length $L (L> M)$
2. : Calculate the length N=L+M-1
3. : Add $M-1$ zeros on each segment (length = L) of $x(n)$
4. : Make impulse response to length $N$ by adding zeros
5. : Find the circular convolution of each new segments with new $h(n)$
6. : Add last and first $M-1$ points of each segments, discard/remove excess point than $L,+M-1$
