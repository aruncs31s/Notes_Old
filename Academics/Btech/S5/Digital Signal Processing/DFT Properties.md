#### Circular Shift Property

From Eq. (3.15) the periodic extension of the sequence (1) can be written as
$$
x_p(n)= \sum_{l=- \infty} ^ \infty  x(n - lN)
$$


One way of visualizing the periodic sequence $x_{p}(n)$ is wrapping the finite duration sequence $x(n)$ around a circle in counterclockwise direction, which is selected as
