# Matter Standard

Matter is a freely available ==connectivity standard== for smart home and Internet of Things(Iot). Matter Standard formerly known as **CHIP**(**Connected Home over IP**)

- It aims to improve `interoperability` and compatibility between different manufacturer and security and also allow ==local control==.
- It came to exits because of the lack of interoperability among various standards, protocols and manufacturer .

#### Working 


#### Advantages
- The standard operates onÂ **IP** and functions via one or more controllers that connect and manage devices within your local network, This  ==eliminating the need for multiple proprietary hubs==
- Matter-certified products are engineered to operate locally and ==do not depend on an internet connection for their core functions==

### Working With IoT

- To work with the integration between the [[WoT]] and the matter each
  device should have its own Thing Description (TD)
