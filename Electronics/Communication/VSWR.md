# Voltage Standing Wave Ratio
It is a measure of how efficiently radio-frequency power is transmitted ==from a power source, through a transmission line, into a load== . For example from an power amplifier to antenna through a transmission line.

Incident wave (blue) is fully reflected (red wave) out of phase at short-circuited end of transmission line, creating a net voltage (black) standing wave. $\Gamma = âˆ’1, SWR = \infty$.

- The max transfer of power requires exact match between source impedance and load impedance.

$$
VSWR = \frac{1 + |\Gamma |}{1-|\Gamma|}
$$
- It indicates the degree of mismatch between the transmission line and the load
- A higher VSWR indicates more power is being reflected back towards the source, which can lead to inefficiencies and potential damage to the transmitter
