#### Flow of Energy
There is a miss conception that the electrons flowing in the wire that carries the energy but in reality the `Electric` and `Magnetic field` that carries the energy.

$$

\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vec{E} \times \vec{B} \tag{poyniting Theorem}
$$

It defines the power per unit area transmitted by an electromagnetic wave. The [[Academics/Btech/S6/ElectroMagnetics/Module 3#^1fe371|Poynting Vector]] ($\vec{S}$) points in the direction of energy flow and its magnitude gives the rate of energy transfer per unit area perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
