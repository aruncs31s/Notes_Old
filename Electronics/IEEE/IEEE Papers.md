#### A Novel SRR Loaded Asymmetrical CPW Fed ISM Band Wearable Antenna for Health Monitoring Applications
The proposed coplanar waveguide (CPW) fed split ring resonator loaded wearable antenna will be used for short-distance ISM band biomedical communication for health care monitoring applications , This antenna is designed to fine-tune at resonating frequency 2.45GHz, one of **Industrial scientific-medical (ISM)** band.
- This is [[meta-material]] based antenna -> High Gain
- [ ] What is ISM Band
- [ ] What is This is meta-material based antenna
- [ ] What is split ring resonator
loaded antenna has enhanced the bandwidth and gain

- The minimum return loss attains -41.2dB and
-28.9dB at 2.45GHz
