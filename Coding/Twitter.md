## Twitter API

### Developer Apps
1. [Developer apps portal page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps)
2. [[OAuth 2.0]]

Accessing the Twitter API and Twitter Ads API requires a set of authentication credentials, also known as keys and tokens, that you must pass with each request. These credentials can come in different forms depending on the type of authentication that is required by the specific endpoint that you are using.

>[!NOTE] API Key and Secret 
> API Key and Secret(==Consumer Key and secret==) :  the most fundamental credentials required to access the Twitter API , These credentials act as the u==sername and password== for your Twitter App, and are used by the Twitter API to understand which App requests are coming from.These credentials can be used by [authentication endpoints](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/api-reference) to generate additional credentials, such as [user Access Tokens and Secrets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens), and [Bearer Tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens). You also need to use these credentials along with Access Tokens and other authorization parameters to [authorize requests](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/authorizing-a-request) that require OAuth 1.0a User Context authentication


> [!NOTE] Access Token and Secret
> **[Access Token and Secret](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens):** In general, ==Access Tokens represent the user that you are making the request on behalf of.== The ones that you can generate via the developer portal represent the user that owns the App. You will use these to authenticate requests that require [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a). If you would like to make requests on behalf of another user, you will need to use the 3-legged OAuth flow for them to authorize you.

>[!NOTE] Client ID and Client Secret
>**[Client ID and Client Secret](https://developer.twitter.com/content/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token):** These credentials are used to obtain a user Access Token with OAuth 2.0 authentication. Similar to OAuth 1.0a, the user Access Tokens are used to authenticate requests that provide private user account information or perform actions on behalf of another account but, with fine-grained scope for greater control over what access the client application has on the user.

> [!NOTE] App only Access Token
>  **[App only Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens):** You will use this token when making requests to endpoints that responds with information publicly available on Twitter

### How to acquire an API Key and Secret

1. [Sign up for a Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)
2. Create a [Twitter App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps) within the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal). Note that if you would like to use [Twitter API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access), you must add your Twitter App to a [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).
