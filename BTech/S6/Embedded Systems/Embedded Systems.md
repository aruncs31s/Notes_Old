# Embedded Systems

*It an Electro-mechanical which is a ==combination of software and hardware design(working together) to do a specific task==*
*It is any device that includes a programmable computer but is not itself intended to be a general-purpose computer. Thus, a PC is not itself an embedded computing system, although PCs are often used to build embedded computing systems. But a fax machine or a clock built from a microprocessor is an embedded computing system.*

- [Context Switching]()
- Shared Memory
- Dead Lock

> [!NOTE] Dead Lock
> If two task were tring to access the same resource at the same time ,This situation is known as `Dead Lock`
