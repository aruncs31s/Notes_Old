# Embedded Systems

*It an Electro-mechanical which is a ==combination of software and hardware design(working together) to do a specific task==*
*It is any device that includes a programmable computer but is not itself intended to be a general-purpose computer. Thus, a PC is not itself an embedded computing system, although PCs are often used to build embedded computing systems. But a fax machine or a clock built from a microprocessor is an embedded computing system.*

### I/O Devices

### Interupts
An interrupt is a signal that is sent to the processor (CPU) to indicate that an event has occurred and requires attention
#### ISR 
Interupt Service Routine(ISR) It is a software routine that gets executed in response to a Interupt Signal  generated by a hardware or software event. When interupt occurs the processor suspends the current program execution and jumps to the corresponding interrupt service routine to handle the interrupt
Interupt Handling is done by following stages

1. I**dentifying the source of the interrupt**: The ISR needs to determine which device or event has caused the interrupt.
2. **Saving the processor state**: Before handling the interrupt, the ISR saves the current state of the processor, including the program counter, registers, and other relevant information, so that the interrupted program can be resumed correctly after the ISR has completed.
3. **Performing the necessary actions:** The ISR performs the appropriate actions to respond to the interrupt, such as reading data from a device, writing data to a device, or updating internal data structures.
4. **Clearing the interrupt**: The ISR clears the interrupt signal to indicate that the interrupt has been handled, so that the processor can return to the interrupted program.
5. **Restoring the processor state**: After handling the interrupt, the ISR restores the saved processor state, allowing the interrupted program to resume execution from the point where it was interrupted.
