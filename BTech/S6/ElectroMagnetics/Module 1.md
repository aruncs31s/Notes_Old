### Introduction
*Electromagnetic theory is a branch of physics that deals with the study of electromagnetic fields, which are the interaction of electric and magnetic fields. It encompasses the laws and principles that govern these fields, as well as their behavior and effects on matter.*

1. **Maxwell's Equations**: These are a set of four fundamental equations formulated by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century. They describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges and currents, how they propagate through space, and how they interact with each other.
    
2. **Electromagnetic Waves**: Maxwell's equations predict the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are disturbances in the electromagnetic field that propagate through space at the speed of light. These waves include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.
    
3. **Electromagnetic Radiation**: This refers to the energy carried by electromagnetic waves. It includes various forms of radiation, such as light from the sun, radio waves from communication devices, and X-rays used in medical imaging.
    
4. **Electromagnetic Phenomena**: Electromagnetic theory explains a wide range of phenomena, including the behavior of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields, the operation of electrical circuits, the generation and transmission of electromagnetic waves, and the interaction of light with matter.
    
5. **Applications**: Electromagnetic theory has numerous practical applications in technology and engineering, including telecommunications, electronics, power generation and transmission, radar systems, medical imaging, and many others

## Prerequisites
- [Vector Algebra](Science/Maths/Maths.md#Vector%20Algebra)
- [Del Operator](Science/Maths/Maths.md#Del%20Operator)


#### Electric Fields

#### Electric Flux
The electric flux through an area is defined as the number of electric field lines passing through that area normally.

If the electric field at a certain point be $\overrightarrow E$

Then, the electric flux through an infinitesimal area with an area vector $\overrightarrow{dS}$ around that point will be given by:

$d \phi = \overrightarrow E . \overrightarrow dS$

**Electric Field Intensity**

The electric field intensity at a point in an electric field is the electric force[^10] experienced by a unit positive point charge located at that particular point.

[^10]: Force is a physical quatity used to move something 
**Electric Flux Density**

Electric flux density is the electric flux passing through a unit area normal to the direction of the flux.

**Relation between Electric Field Intensity and Electric Flux Density**

The electric flux density (D→) is equal to the electric field intensity (E→) multiplied by the permittivity (ε) of the medium concerned.

This, we write:

D→=εE→.

The electric field intensity at a distance r from a point charge

E→=14πε⋅qr2 r^.

The electric flux density at the same point will be given by:

D→=εE→D→=ε×14πε⋅qr2 r^D→=q4πr2 r^

### Gauss Divergence Theorem
- It can be used to see the location of `source`[^4.1] and `sink`[^4.1]
- It explains rate of change of function with respect to position
- It is a flux density[^3], it explains how much flux is entering or leaving the source[^1] or sink[^2]
- If divergence[^4] is positive then that acting like a source and if negative it acting like a sink

[^4.1]: A source is a ==component or device that provides power to a circuit==. This could be a battery, a power supply, or any other device that generates electrical energy. In a circuit, the source is where the electrical energy begins its journey. It is the ==starting point for the flow of current==
[^4.2]:  A sink is a ==component or device that consumes power from a circuit==

#statement
$$
\oint P.dS = \oint \overrightarrow \nabla . \overrightarrow P \ dV 
$$

> [!WARNING] Relation
> *surface intetegral of that function is = volume intetegral of  [[Divergence of a Vector|Divergence]] of that function* 
> So it explains the relationship between surface intetegral and volume intetegral



#proof 
1. Divergence of $\overrightarrow P$ can be calculated by the following expression

$Div(P) = \overrightarrow \nabla . \overrightarrow P = \underset{\Delta V  \to \infty}{\lim} \frac{\oint \overrightarrow P\, dS}{\Delta V}$

2. This calculation can be done by

$\underset{\Delta V \to \infty}{\lim}  \overrightarrow \nabla . \overrightarrow P \ \Delta V$ = $\underset{\Delta V  \to \infty}{\lim} \oint \overrightarrow P \ dS$

3. And says that ==Volume Integration of Divergence of P = Surface intetegral of Function P==

$$
\oint P.dS = \oint \overrightarrow \nabla . \overrightarrow P \ dV 
$$


> [!important] Summary
> 		This proof comes form the basic definition of divergence as in stage 1 and it basically says that ==taking volume integral of divergence of a function is same as taking the surface integral of that function==


#uses
1. It is used in application of fluid mechanics
2. It is used to understand electromechanics
3. It is used to understand the flaw of fields (eg : [[Science/Quantum Mechanics/Gravitational Field|Gravitational Fields]],[Electric Field](#electric%20fields) 
4. Used in aerodynamics

#exampleProblem
- If $\overrightarrow F = xy \hat i_x \ + yz \hat i_y \ + zx \hat i_z$ and $a = 1 , b = 3 , c = 2$ then 
  1. Determine $\int \overrightarrow \nabla . \overrightarrow F dV$
  2. Determine $\oint \overrightarrow F . \overrightarrow{dS}$
  3. Verify Divergence Theorem

1. Determining $\int \overrightarrow \nabla . \overrightarrow F dV$

$\overrightarrow \nabla . \overrightarrow F = \frac{\partial (Fx)}{\partial x} +  \frac{\partial (Fy)}{\partial y} +  \frac{\partial (Fz)}{\partial z}$

Which is 
$= y +z + x$

  - We have  $a =1 , b=3 ,z =2$ which implies

$0 \textless x \textless 1$
$0 \textless y \textless 3$
$0 \textless z \textless 2$


- Therefore 

$\int \overrightarrow \nabla . \overrightarrow F dV =  \int_{0}^{2} \int_{0}^{3} \int_{0}^{1} (y+z+x)dxdydz$

$=  \int_{0}^{2} \int_{0}^{3} [yx+z+\frac{x^2}{2}]_{0}^{1}dydz$

$=  \int_{0}^{2} \int_{0}^{3} (y+z+\frac{1}{2})dydz$

$=  \int_{0}^{2}  [{y^2 \over 2} +zy+\frac{1}{2}y]_{0}^{3}dz$

$=  \int_{0}^{2}  ({9\over 2} +3z+\frac{3}{2})dz$

$=  \int_{0}^{2}  ( 6+3z)dz$


$=    [ 6z+{3z^2 \over 2} ]_{0}^{2}$

$= 12 + 6 = 18$



$\int \overrightarrow \nabla . \overrightarrow F dV = 18$

### Stokes Theorem
- Stokes theorem explains relationship in between ==line Integration== and ==surface integration==
- Stokes theorem is based on [[Curl.md|Curl]] of the function

#statement 
$$
\oint \overrightarrow P.dl = \int \overrightarrow \nabla \times \overrightarrow P \ dS
$$

#proof
1. Curl of a function $\overrightarrow P$ is

$Curl(\overrightarrow P) =  \overrightarrow \nabla \times \overrightarrow P = \underset{\Delta S \to 0}{\lim} \frac {\oint \overrightarrow P dl}{\Delta S}$ 

2. 

=> $\underset{\Delta S \to 0}{\lim} \overrightarrow \nabla \times \overrightarrow P \ \Delta S = \underset{\Delta S \to 0}{\lim} \oint \overrightarrow P dl$

*Which is basically [[Science/Maths/Integration|integration]]*
> [!NOTE] Integration 
> $\underset{\Delta S \to 0}{\lim} a \ function = its \ integral$

3. 

$$
\oint \overrightarrow P.dl = \int \overrightarrow \nabla \times \overrightarrow P \ dS
$$
