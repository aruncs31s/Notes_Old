# Line Integrals
Line integrals are related to given integration of a vector $A$ along a paths situated on a curve in space

$$
\int_L A.dl = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \left| A \right| dl \cos \theta
$$

> If the path integral is a closed loop along $x_1$ and $x_2$ then

$$
\int_L A.dl = \oint A.dl
$$
>and this is known as contour integral or path intrgral
